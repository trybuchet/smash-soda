Several things have been changed from the old version of Smash Soda (Legacy) to the new version. This page outlines the changes.

## Changes

- Smash Soda's configuration files have been moved from "C:\Users\{USERNAME}\AppData\Roaming\SmashSodaTwo" to "C:\Users\{USERNAME}\AppData\Roaming\Trybuchet\Smash Soda".

- The Smash Soda overlay application has been renamed to "Smash Glass", and no longer needs to be added manually. Smash Soda will automatically download it.
