# Introduction

Smash Soda is an unofficial open source application for hosting rooms on [Parsec](https://parsec.app), developed by the [Soda Arcade](https://soda-arcade.com) team. It is not affiliated with Parsec.

Smash Soda gives greater control over your Parsec session, allowing you to chat with your guests, manage gamepads and more. You can also advertise your room publically with Soda Arcade.

Smash Soda uses a now retired SDK that Parsec used to provide to developers. Due to the SDK's terms, Smash Soda can no longer be distributed as a binary, and must be built from source. 

Be wary downloading Smash Soda builds, as it's open source nature makes it easy for people to smuggle malicious code. You should always build it from source from the official repository ( [https://github.com/soda-arcade/smash-soda](https://github.com/soda-arcade/smash-soda) ) or using the installer script ([https://github.com/soda-arcade/smash-soda/releases/latest/installer.bat](https://github.com/soda-arcade/smash-soda/releases/latest/installer.bat)).
